# Kafka Java Training

## 1. What is Kafka?

Apache Kafka is basically an **Open-Source** messaging tool developed by **Linkedin** to provide **Low-Latency** and **High-Throughput** platform for the **real-time** data feed.

It is developed using **Scala** and **Java** programming Languages.

In general, a Stream can be defined as an unbounded and continuous flow of data packets in real-time. 

Data packets are generated in the form of key-value pairs and these are automatically transferred from the publisher, there is no need to place a request for the same.

Apache Kafka Stream can be defined as an open-source client library that is used for building applications and micro-services. 

Here, the input and the output data is stored in Kafka Clusters. 

It integrates the intelligibility of designing and deploying standard Scala and Java applications with the benefits of Kafka server-side cluster technology.
